   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:luchocurti/pi-monitor.git
    cd pi-monitor
    ```

3. Create and Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .
    source bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required Python packages:
